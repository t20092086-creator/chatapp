  <h1>About RealTime Chat</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>RealTime Chat</strong> was created to provide a simple, fast, and secure way for people to stay connected online.
    Unlike traditional messaging apps, RealTime Chat runs directly in your browser — no downloads, no installations,
    and no complicated sign-ups. Our mission is to make chatting effortless, private, and accessible to everyone,
    no matter what device they use.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe communication should be easy, private, and available instantly. That’s why we’ve built a lightweight
    chat platform that puts users first. Whether you’re connecting with friends, family, or your team, RealTime Chat
    helps you stay in touch without unnecessary distractions.
  </p>

  <p>Our focus is on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ Privacy and security — chats are private by design.</li>
    <li>✅ Accessibility — works on any modern device with a browser.</li>
    <li>✅ Simplicity — no technical knowledge required.</li>
  </ul>
